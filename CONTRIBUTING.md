# How to contribute

First of all, we are glad you're reading this prior to contribution. We need helps
to create a better plugin.

If you are not sure about this projects, or have some questions, don't hesitate and 
contact us on "PatrickKR (at) teamif (dot) io".

This project is maintained in Korean, so if you are not familiar with it, it would be
hard to contribute, and we can't change the project to be English. Sorry on that part.

## Before Contributing

Before making any pull requests, please make an issue related to the contribution. That
way, we could maintain our project easily. Also, we would like to suggest you to test
before contributing. The recommended test environment is "Spigot 1.12.2".

## Coding Conventions

1. We prefer the single class imports. Try not to use Asterisks(*).
2. Javadoc is recommended. It is easier for other developers to understand the code.
3. Indenting style must be OTBS (One True Brace Style).

## Our Goal

We are trying to make a RPG plugin which is requested by an anonymous person. Your help
could make our project become better. If there are any problems/questions about this,
we are happy to hear at:
